A page-replacement algorithm is used to decide which frames to replace.This project 
will implement 3 fundamental page-replacement 
algorithms: First-In-First-Out (FIFO), Optimal (OPT), and Least Recently Used (LRU).

Please type following command to run the files:
gcc -std=c99 -o page_replacement page_replacement.c
chmod u+x page_replacement

./page_replacement < in01.txt 
./page_replacement > output.txt

you can also check the difference between the output and the output file.
